## 2025-02-18 - Accessibility Gaps in Auth Forms
**Learning:** The authentication forms (`Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`) were missing basic accessibility features like `htmlFor` label associations and `aria-label` for icon-only buttons, despite having a polished visual design. This suggests a pattern where accessibility might be overlooked in favor of aesthetics.
**Action:** When working on other forms in this project, proactively check for label associations and missing ARIA labels on icon buttons.
